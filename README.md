## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. I am co-advised by Finale Doshi-Velez of the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) Lab](https://dtak.github.io/) and Susan Murphy of the [Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html). My research focuses on reinforcement learning and machine learning for healthcare.

Before my return to academia, I worked for nearly a decade in quantitative finance at various hedge funds and trading firms.
